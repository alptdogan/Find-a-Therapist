# find-a-therapist-web-app

A web application which you can register either as a therapist to display your profile or a client to be seen by therapists. A client can see registered therapists as a list, view their profile and contact them via their contact information.

Technologies used:

Spring Boot,
MongoDB,
Lombok,
Spring Security,
Thmeleaf.



To login as a client;

username: client ||
password: client

As a therapist;

username: therapist ||
password: therapist

As an admin;

username: admin ||
password: admin

App does not actually differs for logins as clients, therapists nor an admin. Might add a registration layer later.

I should also work on authentication which will be updated soon. Have a nice day!
